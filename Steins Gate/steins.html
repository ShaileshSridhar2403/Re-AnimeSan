						The self-proclaimed mad scientist Rintarou Okabe rents out a room in a rickety old building in Akihabara, where he indulges himself in his hobby of inventing prospective "future gadgets" with fellow lab members: Mayuri Shiina, his air-headed childhood friend, and Hashida Itaru, a perverted hacker nicknamed "Daru." The three pass the time by tinkering with their most promising contraption yet, a machine dubbed the "Phone Microwave," which performs the strange function of morphing bananas into piles of green gel.
						<br/><br/>Though miraculous in itself, the phenomenon doesn't provide anything concrete in Okabe's search for a scientific breakthrough; that is, until the lab members are spurred into action by a string of mysterious happenings before stumbling upon an unexpected success—the Phone Microwave can send emails to the past, altering the flow of history.
						<br/><br/>Adapted from the critically acclaimed visual novel by 5pb. and Nitroplus, Steins;Gate takes Okabe through the depths of scientific theory and practicality. Forced across the diverging threads of past and present, Okabe must shoulder the burdens that come with holding the key to the realm of time

				<score>10/10 <br/><br/><reviewer>Them Anime</reviewer></score>
				<p>That's right. You heard me. Time Travel.
<p>Don't worry, I groaned too. It's a pretty natural reaction to one of the most hackneyed, ill-used and ill-regarded clichés in the writers' handbook. You've seen it done, I've seen it done, within animé and beyond it but don't stop reading here and definitely do not give up on watching this. I'll explain why. This show isn't about time travel. Yes, it is there and it is the key component of the narrative but this show isn't about that. It's about Okabe Rintarou. Science fiction as a whole can be summed up to be about at least one of three things: the technology, the society or the individual. Steins;Gate falls firmly in the third of those three. Time travel is a catalyst to drive the characters together and in this intention I can find no fault.
<p>I'll get back to that in a minute. I want to talk about aesthetics first.
<p>To be fair to this series; time travel has never looked so good. The almost sun-beaten streets of Akihabara are evocatively bleak and form a pristine but strangely foreboding backdrop to the proceedings, almost too clinical but also too fuzzy to be comforting. This is not Durarara's carnival of the night with lights, sleaze and glitz but more like the cities I've lived in personally - lifeless but ever moving, like sand in the desert wind. It evokes some of my favourite moments of Serial Experiments Lain where Lain would walk through the morning streets in the shadows of the power lines. It's not a surprising comparison when you take into account that both directors have worked on Yoshitoshi ABe drawn productions before including SE Lain itself and they certainly knew their trade back then. Steins;Gate proves they have not lost their touch.
<p>In this respect it seems pertinent to consider the directors themselves. Hiroshi Hamasaki (of Shigurui and Texhnolyze fame, amongst others) and Takuya Sato (of Ichigo Mashimaro fame, amongst others) seem like an extremely odd choice for collaboration taking into account the former's history of uncompromising almost nihilistic drama and the latter's history of the most pleasant of comedy but it's certainly a combination that worked. Unrelenting bleakness would not have suited the series and Sato's characteristic light-heartedness perhaps might have been too soft for the intent but somehow both styles seem to have met and melded with an astounding synchronicity. A lot of animé have a jarring jerkiness when they shift between light-heartedness and deathly seriousness but Steins;Gate manages to move between them seamlessly. It's not quite the pitch (black) perfection of Masaaki Yuasa's mocking, flesh-stripping gaze but it's amazing that the director of Texhnolyze and Shigurui and the director of Ichigo Mashimaro can come together in such perfect synthesis. To be honest, I'm still astounded how well the comedy present mixes with the more serious plot elements.
<p>The key to this has to be the characters. The characters, like the plot, will seem atrocious if I break them down individually: the childish, nonsense spouting but occasionally brilliant Okabe; the fat, perverted but kind-hearted Daru; the Tsunderish genius Makise; ditsy childhood friend Mayuri; the scarily androgynous doormat Ruka; and so on, but that might just be the point. One criticism I've heard levied and have some sympathy for is the complaint that Okabe is really annoying. I can see that, he is at the beginning. The thing is... he changes. They all do. Some shows have their characters defined within minutes and never waver but, as I said before, this isn't about the comedy; it isn't about the angst or a crazy, mind blowing science fiction world laden neck deep in symbolism. It's about a group of friends, alienated from society at large, that make a time machine and how that affects their lives and relationships. What makes this worthwhile though? What makes this strange bunch worth watching over twenty-four episodes? I'll tell you in one beautiful phrase: damn good writing.
<p>To be honest, I was surprised. Okabe and Makise, in particular, are individually unimpressive characters. I do not know everyone's take on tsundere characters but I am not overly fond of them; they are at best cliché and at worst despicable, and Okabe's over the top weirdness and ramblings can be just as tiresome yet somehow together these two characters have real chemistry. Their bickering is genuinely amusing and their intimate moments are genuinely touching. It is in these things every major character is redeemed in my eyes. A childhood friend is at least as clichéd as a tsundere but through Mayuri's and Okabe's interactions; what they talk about and even the way they look at each other, the childhood friend tag actually means something. There is history.
<p>All this does not come without a price though. The gentle build up of characterisation is effective but slow. The first half of the series, while still very entertaining, seems to lack a little bit of direction while it builds up steam. Also Okabe really is embarrassing to watch earlier on in the show especially before he has Makise to call him on it (which happens mercifully quickly) but it really does take the show time to start building his character to a meaningful level and the wait can be a little tiring.
<p>In the end it is a sacrifice that I'm willing to make. In exchange for a slow build up and an irritating lead I get a pitch perfect turning point and a thrilling climax that must be amongst the most satisfying endings in science-fiction animé history if not animé in general. We get relationships we can invest in and we get characters that properly progress through beginning, middle and end. It's a show that takes us somewhere. It might not be anywhere that deep but it is affecting, fun and deeply enjoyable. </p>

<p><i>It lacks the urgency and thematic depth of many shows that I would rate at five stars but I really can't argue with the sheer competency of this production on so many levels. Complexity is handled with insight and maturity that I would love to qualify but I do not want to spoil it for you all. It is far better for you to go and see rather than I tell you. -1 star if you really cannot stand Okabe - either way you should just bear with it. It gets better.</i></p>
<p><i><b>Recommended Audience:</b> Teens and up. There is some violence, a reasonably complex plot and some adult humour from Daru.</i></p>

WOW, now this was an amazing anime. Its been a long while since I was
this interested in an anime and enjoyed it this much.<br><br>The characters in this anime are just AWESOME. They are so well made
and you just get to love them immediately. The main protagonist is a
great one. I immediately liked him and he just kept on getting better
and better. Loved his dialogues and character. I self proclaimed evil
mad scientist who is a actually a good guy. You get to feel for and
love every main character, and even some of the side characters. Their
meetings, bafoonery etc etc, its just fun to watch.<br><br>The writing and dialogue in this anime is another thing I really liked,
its just awesome. The anime might seem slow paced to many because it is
basically dialogue and interactions for the first few episodes but not
for me. It was so enjoyable that it didn&#x27;t even seemed a tad bit boring
or slow paced. <br><br>Story is also a great one. It is not everyday you get to see a take on
time travelling in this way, which is very personal and emotional. You
get to see and feel that messing with time, even a tad bit is no joke
and shouldn&#x27;t be taken lightly. It can have great consequences. Even
when the plot thickens and gets big, the anime never lets go of its
personal touch and feeling instead of pursuing grandeur scenes. The
anime is really humorous too at times. But it doesn&#x27;t get way too much
that a person starts cringing or groaning, which is the case with many
animes. In fact, the humour in it is one of the best displayed I have
seen in an anime which is not specifically a Comedy anime. It doesn&#x27;t
get childish or too animeish etc. It just stays right. I had a pretty
good laughs at some scenes while in others a smile was always present
on my face.<br><br>Animation is really good, well defined and detail and pretty to look
at. Soundtrack is also really good. Sets the mood in emotional scenes
and is rightly appropriate for funny scenes. <br><br>I do wish that the anime was a little longer so that they could have
shown some background of some of the main characters. <br><br>Overall, I would say, a really great anime and of the best take on time
travelling I have ever seen.

				<score>9.15/10 <br/><br/><reviewer>My Anime List</reviewer></score>
				“No one knows what the future holds. That’s why its potential is infinite.”<br />
Okabe Rintarou (Steins;Gate)<br />
<br />
<br />
Such a powerful quote, from an anime at least just as powerful. It’s one of the many wise quotes featured in the excellent time travelling tale called Steins;Gate. It is a story praised by many, and I think the show is definitely worthy of all its praise: it’s an excellent piece of work. Steins;Gate is, in essence, a unique anime. There’s not a single show that I found to be comparable to Steins;Gate.<br />
But why does everyone think of Steins;Gate as such a masterpiece?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Story: 10/10<br />
Steins;Gate is about Okabe Rintarou, a “mad scientist”

          <span style="display: none;" id="review145393">
        who spends his time hanging out in his laboratory with his friends Mayuri and Daru. Ocassionally, they manage to invent futuristic gadgets, though these are never worth mentioning. The first few episodes may turn you down, as it seems like your general slice of life/comedy anime. However, when their most interesting invention, the Phone Microwave, turns out to be able to send text messages through time, everything changes: the text messages sent to the past have a huge impact on the present. When Okabe, in a horrifying way, finds out about an evil organization called SERN, and their ways, he is forced to use time travelling methods to prevent from getting captured – and stop their plans. This (around episode 9) is where the amazing Sci-Fi thriller fires up its engines, and puts the viewer on the edge of their seat. What follows is a fascinating (somewhat complex) plot, which manages to blow your mind each episode. Steins;Gate is not just your generic time traveling show; the plot is executed perfectly. Hardly ever before have I encountered such a well thought through plot as featured in Steins;Gate. The show features several jumps in time, but still manages to keep the viewers’ attention without confusing them. The pace present in Steins;Gate is not lacking either – in fact, from episode 9 onwards the show holds a perfect pace. Piece by piece, the mystery of the events that happen is unveiled, working towards a fantastic, satisfying ending. (Which is very rare, especially for a show with such a complex plot) Story - and plot wise, Steins;Gate is pretty much an unprecedented piece of art, and I think it might stay so for a while.<br />
<br />
<br />
Art: 8/10<br />
This is the field in which Steins;Gate lacks the most. Steins;Gate isn’t a show with a huge budget, and therefore it is to be expected that the art isn’t jaw-dropping. However, this doesn’t mean that the art is bad, or that the drawing style is unbearable. In fact, the goal of the art is to portray the atmosphere as well as possible – and it does: the art style simply has a way more realistic feel to it than your generic anime.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sound: 8/10<br />
Amazing voice acting, nice opening, and decent BGM. There were quite some moments where I think there could have been made better use of background music, which is why it misses out on a perfect score here. Nonetheless, very solid sound overall.<br />
<br />
<br />
Characters: 10/10<br />
What can I say, the characterization in this one is just fantastic. The characters are written in such a way that you are bound to like them. They all have their own likeable and recognizable traits, which are perfectly described from the start: Makise Kurisu the tsundere, Daru the nerd, Mayuri the childish girl, and so on. I found myself having a weak spot for Kurisu in no time. There’s hardly any character development, but I think this is not necessarily a bad thing; it would only distract from the fantastic plot that is ahead of the viewer. The only character which, logically so, develops, is Okabe: you’ll find him changing in character over the course of episodes, due to the events that unfold. But this is all for the better: this development is, again, done exceptionally well. The development has a very realistic feeling to it (And so do all the characters in general), which makes the story as a whole even more compelling. <br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10/10<br />
Steins;Gate is one of the few shows that manages to score a 10 on enjoyment for me. Like most people, I found Steins;Gate hard to get into, as the first few episodes don’t really cover much ground. However, once the engine got running, I was hooked. I couldn’t refrain myself from watching episode after episode, slowly crawling to the awesome ending ahead. And I think most people would; as the plot is set up in such a way to keep you hooked each episode. If you are a fan of Sci-Fi, then you will surely enjoy this anime – but that’s not a necessity. Steins;Gate is an anime that is very likely to keep you hooked. So go ahead, you won&#039;t waste your precious time. In fact, you might want to go back in time to watch it again!<br />
