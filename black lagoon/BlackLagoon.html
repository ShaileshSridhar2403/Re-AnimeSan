   <review id="content">
            <score>10/10 </br><br/><reviewer>Ani Help</reviewer></score>
			<p>Plot:<br />
The Anime centres around the Lagoon company, a group of four pirates who are based in Roanapur, which is the land of criminals and everything illegal.<br />
The main character is Rockuro Okajima (called "Rock" by his co-workers) who is captured by the Lagoon company after being called on to deliver a disk to the Russain Mafia, he is kept as a hostage but joins the Lagoon company<br />
after Revy invites him. The series follows all the jobs they have and all the trouble they run into. It's more of a action Anime above anything else as in every episode there can always be a gun fight to be expected.<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
<br />
Rockuro 'Rock' Okajima: Rock is a Japanese buisnessman, whom works for the Lagoon company after choosing to join them. It is known that Rock is a man of reason and doesn't agree with Revy's violent ways of dealing with situations. <br />
It is also known he has never picked up a gun in his life, but although this is true, his voice of reason and understanding is often known to get the crew out of scrapes...Much to Revy's surprise. Rock is much different from<br />
everyone else in Roanapur as he always manages to remain 'sane' as he puts it.<br />
<br />
Rebecca 'Revy' Lee: Revy is a Chinese-American pirate for the Lagoon company, also known as 'Two Hands' by the citizens of Roanapur, she is the gunman of the crew and always resorts to violence for every situation. She<br />
uses Sword Cutlass (also known as custom M9 Barretta's) but sometimes uses other weapons too. Unlike Rock, Revy believes in shoot first, ask questions later which often gets her into trouble. She is also a bit of a tsundere type too.<br />
Revy is also a heavy smoker and drinker...And a bit of a potty mouth. <br />
<br />
Dutch: Although little is known about Dutch, he's the boss of the Lagoon company and deals with all job related inquiries. His personality isn't very well known but it is visible that he does care for the other members of his crew.<br />
Dutch is also one to use guns, although he mostly likes to let Revy deal with that.<br />
<br />
Benny: Benny is Jewish, he is often seen at his computer (which he won't let anyone touch) and like Rock, doesn't believe in violence and also has never picked up a gun. <br />
<br />
The Lagoon company run into other coloruful characters in the series, such as Roberta, Jane and Hansel and Gretel. <br />
<br />
Positive:<br />
<br />
This is my overall favourite Anime and for such a good reason, it's not just violence, this Anime also has a very good plotline to it, and it's always interesting to see the characters back stories once they are revealed.<br />
The characters all have different personalities and backgrounds, and it's a good thing, because they are all different in their own way it makes the Anime really good to watch. The characters interactions towards each other<br />
are all different also, which leads to interesting situations. It's not so much of a fantasy Anime either, it's realistic, but within reason. It's not so realistic that it makes it boring to watch at points, but it's not<br />
extremely unrealistic either. <br />
<br />
Negative:<br />
<br />
There is a reason why most people tend to dislike this Anime: violence and language. This Anime is heavily packed with language, as during the first series alone (12 episodes) the f bomb is dropped more than 100 times and it's<br />
mostly by Revy. It's definitely not an Anime for younger audiences. There is also a heavy amount of violence, with a gun fight in almost every episode. This Anime definitely isn't for people who cannot handle language and violence,<br />
there is also a fair bit of blood and sometimes some sexual content. <br />
<br />
Overall opinion:<br />
<br />
Despite the negatives, I do think this is a really good Anime, some of the characters are really badass and it's worth a watch for anyone who likes action. It can also be catagorised as a comedy at some moments as the characters<br />
do have senses of humour. Although I definitely think they could slow down on the f bombs, but it's what makes the characters themselves. It's more proof as why Black Lagoon is my favourite Anime. <br></p>

    <p>Guns, cigarettes, criminals and blood; a whole lot of blood. These are the supporting pillars of Black Lagoon. Our story begins when a ship carrying the Japanese salaryman Okajima Rokuro is attacked by pirates and he is taken hostage. After his company brassily refuses to negotiate with the pirates Rokuro has a change of heart, crosses sides and join the pirates. He receives the nickname Rock and becomes part of the Lagoon company &#8211; a courier company that works on the black market and does odd jobs, some of which are outright illegal. The other members of Lagoon are the American Dutch, the American-Chinese Revy and the Australian Benny. Their base of operations is Roanapur &#8211; a lawless city on an island in the Indian ocean. It is a place where ex-soldiers, prostitutes, blacklisted criminals, and organized crime syndicates roam in broad daylight. The Lagoon company takes any job that crosses their way. Most of the time they serve these &#8220;fine&#8221; criminal organizations. But on the rare occasions when something goes terribly wrong and an organization or person turns against them Lagoon are<br />
thrown directly in the line of fire and must kill and blast their way into safety.</p>
<p>Rock doesn&#8217;t regret leaving his grey, somewhat degrading, salaryman office job and becoming a pirate, but his new position renders him in the middle of violent struggles and immoral acts that he often finds shocking. As a result he constantly needs to walk the fine line that will allow him to keep profiting from his thrilling new occupation without staining his hands with other people&#8217;s blood. Although it is not immediately noticeable Rock is a strong-willed character with enough guts to stand up for himself and his beliefs. Not all of his peers approve of his middle-road beliefs though. The hot-headed Revi doesn&#8217;t waste time in telling him how she despises him and the two&#8217;s relationship eventually reaches a breaking point that ends in a surprising manner. From there on the two work as a team and become somewhat of an odd, not completely functional, couple. If Rock is an example of an obedient law-respecting person Revi is anything but. Her past is a harsh and cold one. She dresses sloppily, kill people without a second thought and is a prime specimen of the dirty twisted criminals that populated city slums around the world. Although the other members of Lagoon &#8211; Duch and Benny &#8211; almost always receive some screen time during the show they are never at the focus of attention. There is, however, a third character whose importance equals that of Rock and Revi – Hotel Moscow&#8217;s Russian leader Balalaika. Balalaika and her direct underlings are ex-soldiers who fought for the Soviet Union. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union she and her fellow soldiers decided to work from the underground to resurrect it. Because Hotel Moscow is made of ex-soldiers it is one, if not the, most powerful forces in Roanapur. And unlike Rock, who is timid, and Revi, who will kill is she needs to, Balalaika is cruel to the core. Her personality literally colors Roanapur red with blood and she has a delicate and special relationship with Revi and Rock.</p>
<p>If it wasn&#8217;t clear enough by now Black Lagoon is a pure action series, with gunfights and explosions occurring on a regular basis. The series manages to stay relevant and entertaining thanks to the surprisingly large pool of ideas it derives its stories from. During the show&#8217;s 24 episodes&#8217; length the Lagoon crew encounters anti-establishment activists, Nazis, psychotic murderers, Italian mafia members, Japanese yakuza and much much more. Black Lagoon differentiates itself from most anime by the sheer amount of swearing said throughout it. Everyone and his little sister swears, and in several languages at that. Notably Black Lagoon is also the only anime from the 1990s to feature detailed real world money and has more than four languages spoken throughout it (if you listen to the Japanese dub that is). All the swearing, drinking, smoking and killing quickly swoops us into a groove that is as addictive as it is rewarding. Each story arch is comprised of three or four episodes – just enough to keep us engaged without becoming long or grueling. Of course, just like any other series Black Lagoon has its ups and downs. Incredibly though these ups and downs are well balanced – when the story elements fall short Rock, Revi and the rest of the characters pull their weight and bring the series back up on track fast.</p><p>Black Lagoon is a wonderful show that manages to get almost everything right. The action if furious, the plot is solid, Rock is a great main character and the sordid nature of the black society is present throughout. It&#8217;s also a straightforward series with an effective formula and good looks. There is no excuse not to watch Black Lagoon. If you like anime and are not afraid of blood Black Lagoon is a must-see series and also a great addition to any collector&#8217;s shelf.</p>

<p>Black Lagoon works on many levels. On the surface it is just another action anime with some comedic elements to break up the often bloody and intense atmosphere and could easily be mistaken for that just seeing one episode. However, the series really deals with the human condition and what would make someone turn their back on a normal life and seek a life in the underworld of crime. For Revy, that answer is simple; she never had a good life to begin with; Revy&#8217;s past was seen to be the worst for much of the series having never had a good life living in a crime filled neighborhood where she had to kill just to live. However, the fifth arc showed that there is always someone worse off.  For Rock, his life was going just fine, but when confronted with the choice he wanted the life of freedom. In spite of his weak-willed personality, he really enjoys the intense moments to the point that their boss, Dutch, fears the consequences should he really be pushed that far; instead he prefers him to work as the accountant and negotiator.<br />
The series constantly has Revy and Rock arguing about idealism in this world. For Rock he wants to hold on to it because of his past and for Revy she never had it because of her past. She is constantly berating him for putting his morales first and causing him, and by extension her and the Lagoon Company, trouble. In the final arc he is confronted by another who also berates him for living within the twilight ― not wanting to live a normal life in Japan, but not wanting to fully embrace the life of the underworld and crime.</p>
<p>More than that though the series plays upon the general themes seen in such epics Paradise Lost by John Milton. In this all of the characters start out with great dreams and ideals hoping to make the world better or even just their family happy. However, each one is tempted after some incident and falls from grace to the underworld of crime or the like. Unlike the poem though, it wasn&#8217;t some incarnation of evil itself that caused these people to fall; instead, it was the betrayal of other humans they knew personally or the general abandonment by the rest of humanity as trash. Even then, they still long for their ideals; however, their eyes are opened and they knew ideals will never come to pass. Sometimes, like with Roberta, they could find a new ideal to live for, but for others, like the twins, it was too late.<br />
In the end the only thing I am disapointed about the series is that it did not explore Rock&#8217;s persoanlity enough. Outside the first arc, he wasn&#8217;t really pushed to the edge and his ability as a skilled negotiator capable of resolving disputes without the need for bloodshed was only hinted at. As mentioned before, Rock still is one of the more idealistic members in the series and it seems clear he has not reached the level where he comfortable with what he&#8217;s become (and not criticizing those around him) while still maintaining his ideals.</p>
<p>If you enjoy hard hitting series and have not been introduced to one of the more thoughtful existentialist series then you need to check it out. It is a great reminder that if violence is needed then the story needs to say something other than kill, kill, kill and hey don&#8217;t forget we are humans. <em><strong>Black Lagoon</strong></em> shows us how easy it would be to turn someone into a heartless killer and how we are not as wonderful a species as we might think.</p>
