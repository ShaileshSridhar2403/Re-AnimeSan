						Centuries ago, mankind was slaughtered to near extinction by monstrous humanoid creatures called titans, forcing humans to hide in fear behind enormous concentric walls. What makes these giants truly terrifying is that their taste for human flesh is not born out of hunger but what appears to be out of pleasure. To ensure their survival, the remnants of humanity began living within defensive barriers, resulting in one hundred years without a single titan encounter. However, that fragile calm is soon shattered when a colossal titan manages to breach the supposedly impregnable outer wall, reigniting the fight for survival against the man-eating abominations.
			<br/><br/>After witnessing a horrific personal loss at the hands of the invading creatures, Eren Yeager dedicates his life to their eradication by enlisting into the Survey Corps, an elite military unit that combats the merciless humanoids outside the protection of the walls. Based on Hajime Isayama's award-winning manga, Shingeki no Kyojin follows Eren, along with his adopted sister Mikasa Ackerman and his childhood friend Armin Arlert, as they join the brutal war against the titans and race to discover a way of defeating them before the last walls are breached.

				<score>10/10 <br/><br/><reviewer>Them Anime</reviewer></score>
				<p>I often come across as a snob, but what I truly abhor, and what often forms the basis of my seemingly snobby negative reviews, is boredom. Though I entered the anime world out of an interest in so-called "art films" (if you can really make a definition for that) and like to find shows and movies where intellectual engagement plays a part in my enjoyment level, I will give credit to a purely entertaining series when it is due. That brings me to <b>Attack on Titan</b>, one of the most popular series of recent years and one that, given its ubiquity in fandom as of 2014, appears to be on its way to becoming iconic. Like other so-called "classic" series I fear it will reach a point at which criticism is impossible, not because it is devoid of flaws but because such status can make a series immune to being called out on them. Indeed, <b>Attack on Titan</b> is far from flawless, but its popularity, and perhaps even its "classic" status when it does come, are deserved in my opinion. It is a thoroughly entertaining series.
<p><b>Attack on Titan</b> succeeds largely because its world is, if imperfectly constructed, terrifying and grim, such that I couldn't help but feel the hopelessness felt by the Titans' targets and, later, be stirred up by the war against them. In part, this owes to the show's visuals. The Titans themselves, more than being simply large and homicidal, are eerie, with human features but with proportions clearly just different enough from normal humans to be offputting. Their mouths open too-widely, they move in a slight "waddle" that makes watching them incredibly unsettling, and the gaze behind their eyes is simultaneously mindless yet completely horrifying. The arguments made that this show has promoted rightwing political beliefs could certainly be substantiated by this aesthetic choice, but it works wonders in establishing the tone of the show. <b>Attack on Titan</b> is, meanwhile, very violent, but while I would suggest the squeamish stay away, the violence in fact went a long way in allowing me to understand the terror the humans felt. Watching characters be mangled, chewed, and eaten, and seeing the expressions on other characters as they witnessed this occurring, it was near-impossible to distance myself. Regardless of whether I liked or disliked the main characters (and as I will discuss, I did have some issues in that regard), I could always feel their terror during these scenes. To be sure, it amounts to manipulation, but it is an especially effective occurrence of it, and I will give credit to it for giving the show the atmosphere it had. Certainly, the musical score, which is oft-repeated but appropriately intense, contributes, as do the fantastic energetic opening songs, which at this point have become about as popular in fandom as the show itself.

<p>I'll also give credit to the show's production staff for using money where it mattered most. <b>Attack on Titan</b> certainly wasn't a terribly high-budget series, and to the chagrin of the manga's fans, it frequently fell behind schedule; a recap episode was devised to give the team some time to catch up, a move which strikes me as a desperate one. But while static scenes are given over to still shots and to speed lines, the scenes in which the animation truly counted, such as those featuring the famous "maneuver gear" used to swing between houses or trees and fight the Titans, looked magnificent to me. Money was also spent on giving appropriate detail to the backgrounds, which is crucial in a series attempting to establish such an atmosphere; even before the Titans appear, the street cobblestones have the appearance of having seen too much wear and far too much human excrement, and the wildlands in which the Titans currently live are drawn as being especially verdant and biodiverse, highlighting the fact that the Titans bother no other living things besides humans and that they have created such a massive waste by leaving verdant land uninhabitable. An important aspect of <b>Attack on Titan</b> is its grim medieval-esque setting, and it is developed excellently here.
<p>It is aspects such as these that allow <b>Attack on Titan</b> to work in spite of its weaknesses, which are certainly there and certainly are not slight. For one thing, Eren himself makes for something of a frustrating protagonist; his seething rages and inopportune exclamations can come across as highly childish, in addition to making him somewhat one-dimensional. I'm certainly not alone in finding him frustrating; friends of mine with whom I watched this described him as being irritating, with one noting that a scene in which he gets away Scot-free with killing a character (a would-be murderer himself, mind you) made him impossible to empathize with. I didn't feel the same about that scene, and regarding his hotheaded personality, in this case I think the circumstances, which far outdo those of most "traumatic backstories" used to justify childish behavior, do provide good enough reason for his behavior that I tolerated him without necessarily liking him. Regardless, he is a polarizing character and is likely to remain so.

<p>I certainly liked the secondary leads far more. Eren's friend Armin, written as a sort of "timid sidekick" character, does grow out of that limiting descriptor thanks to some episodes that are devoted to him and his tactical abilities. Meanwhile, Mikasa, probably the show's best-known character, is also probably the show's strongest, I would argue. She is, in my opinion, one of relatively few physically strong female characters who is not written to have a key vulnerability or secret reliance on a male character; while she does care about Eren, she functions fine without him. In part, she has the role of keeping Eren's idiocy within bounds, an aspect that I appreciated, but while this is a common aspect in shonen anime among female characters, I did feel that the series gives her the license to reach her potential that many female characters are not given; considering how enjoyable her battle scenes are to watch, I would say she reaches it. While I would not necessarily go far enough to say that <b>Attack on Titan</b> is "feminist", I did appreciate that it invokes parity in several ways: the army uniforms are unisex, meaning that fanservice is practically non-existent, the female characters are rarely subjected to sexualized camera angles (I was certainly NOT talking about Mikasa's scenes from the viewpoint of one who enjoys fanservice), and positions of power, at least within the army, are roughly split between the two genders. Arguments over the politics of this show, as well as Mikasa herself, are bound to be lengthy and I will therefore hold myself back somewhat, but I personally found her compelling.
<p>Still, characterization is not the show's greatest strength, and Eren aside, the primary problem is that the supporting cast is very, very large. This might have been less apparent in the source manga, where it is (perhaps) easier to flip back to a previous page in order to refresh oneself on who a character is, but while watching the anime, it was somewhat difficult to invest myself in some of the characters' problems, simply because I had barely seen them before the drama arose. A common complaint against <b>Attack on Titan</b> has been that its pacing is slow, a point that I would echo somewhat with the modification that it is mismatched: early on, we get approximately two episodes to introduce an enormous cast of characters, and then perhaps 7 episodes total of plotting and planning. There is, to be sure, plenty of action in the show, and while watching it I frequently marathoned four or more episodes at a time out of anticipation, which is something I rarely do. Nonetheless, the show decidedly favors scenes of tactical planning over scenes of character development, and more of the latter was necessary for this cast to make the impact. I think that the show's battle scenes do make up for this failing somewhat, and the tactical scenes, which contain more visual aids and less technobabble than in similar and lesser shows, do remain interesting to watch; nonetheless, for those not familiar with the manga, it is hard to keep track of the characters.

<p>If the plot of <b>Attack on Titan</b> is its greatest strength, then one might ask if the plot is flawless. That's certainly not the case, for while I did genuinely enjoy this show's world-building, plot holes can be found if one digs deep enough. There is, for example, the bizarre case of the Titans breaking into the outermost wall and apparently leaving the next outermost wall intact until, conveniently, Eren and his friends have just become members of the army. Relatively little, meanwhile, is explained about how the humans came to build the walls in the first place, or how they were even able, and the show throws in a bizarre detail, that Mikasa and her mother were descended from a small group of Japanese people who made it inside the walls years back, whose significance it never really explains. Now, I certainly am aware that the manga has continued far beyond the point at which the anime is at (the anime, sadly, ends on a bit of a cliffhanger), and so some of this criticism may be irrelevent or become irrelevant as more is animated. Regardless, they don't ruin the show: the plot remains a strength because the show is fabulously entertaining. In spite of how frustrating I found Eren at times, and in spite of my various quibbles, the positive aspects do truly add up to something worth watching. I found it easy to invest myself in it, and that investment was not wasted, as I truly enjoyed the majority of the episodes.
<p>My complaints about <b>Attack on Titan</b> are not meant to dissuade anybody from watching it; rather, they prove that the show is entertaining and engaging enough to survive its flaws, at least in my experience. Whether it becomes an enduring classic or whether the hype it saw in the early 2010s will be short-lived, I think its popularity is deserved.</p>

<p><i>It is nowhere near flawless, but it is extremely entertaining. Avoid if you cannot handle gore, since it is difficult to get around that.</i></p>
<p><i><b>Recommended Audience:</b> Not for children and not for the squeamish. People are eaten alive in gruesome detail; that, I think, is warning enough, but the Titans are also dismembered in gruesome ways, and bloodshed is rampant in most episodes.</i></p>

				<score>8.51/10 <br/><br/><reviewer>My Anime List</reviewer></score>
				Oh dear Shingeki no Kyojin, where do I even begin. If you&#039;ve talked with your friends about anime, then the couple anime that everyone talks about are Naruto, Bleach, One Piece, Dragon Ball, and... Shingeki no Kyojin. What&#039;s the difference between Shingeki and the rest? Shingeki only has 25 episodes so far yet it&#039;s on par in popularity with the other super long, Americanized anime. Why is it popular? Well that&#039;s simply because it&#039;s stunningly amazing. Those people that call Shingeki no Kyojin &quot;overrated&quot; may not have the same taste as me, and that&#039;s perfectly fine, but in my honest opinion, Shingeki no Kyojin is
			 one of if not the greatest anime to be made. It&#039;s not popular for no reason.<br />
<br />
The story is one of the most captivating stories I&#039;ve ever seen. 100 years prior to the start of the anime, humanity has been on the bridge of extinction due to the monstrous humanoid Titans that devour humans. Now, present day in the anime, the remaining small population of mankind lives confined within 3 &quot;heavenly&quot; walls that are so tall and sturdy that even the titans can&#039;t break in. The most outward wall was named, Wall Maria, the middle wall was named Wall Rose, and the most outward wall named Wall Sina. Unfortunately for mankind, a colossal titan, one that is even bigger than the 50 meter heavenly walls, breaks Wall Maria, allowing the other titans to rampage the city, thus leading to another massacre of mankind. During this massacre, our main characters, Eren Yeager and Mikasa Ackerman watch in horror as a horrifying titan rips their mother&#039;s head off, then gobbles her up whole. Vowing that he&#039;d one day avenge mankind and exterminate all the titans, Eren Yeager trains to become a survey corp, brave heroic soldiers who go outside the walls, into the plains in order to fight the titans. But we soon find out, that Eren is much more special than he seems, not only is he a brave warrior, but he&#039;s also something else that could be the key to humanity&#039;s survival, but could also be humanity&#039;s destruction. <br />
<br />
My 3-word thoughts on the anime: Epic, Dynamic, Masterpiece. The suspense build-up was absolutely amazing, yet there was still room for improvement; that shows just how epic this anime can get. The anime not only includes epic fights, but lots of dialogue, and for those of you that hate dialogue, I feel sorry for you people whom only watch for action. The anime includes lots of other things as well: there&#039;s lots of half-hearted, hilarious scenes, as well as sad, tragic scenes. The anime certainly has a good amount of gore, and will break your heart frequently (if you get attached to the characters). Many characters end up getting gobbled up mercilessly while trying to protect humanity in ways that are quite *shivers*. Have I teared up in the anime? As a matter of fact, I have. <br />
<br />
Characters was another area (alongside every area) that was Shingeki&#039;s strongpoint. There&#039;s a diverse variety of characters that fight for humanity for all different reasons. There&#039;s trust, friendship, along with betrayals, and pains. There&#039;s comedy relief among many characters, especially Sasha &quot;Potato Girl&quot; Blouse. There are characters that people can definitely relate with, such as Armin Arlert, who wants to do the right thing and protect his friends, but can&#039;t seem to do much because of fear. Fear is something that haunts us all, and prevents us from doing things in life. Another character that people can somewhat relate with is Annie Leonhardt, who fights alongside humanity, yet fights opposed to humanity. What does that mean? Watch the anime. Why is she doing this? Because of her past scars, &quot;scars have the strange power to remind us that our past is real&quot; (watch to find out more). There were too many characters to development fully, but certainly the main characters were developed to their max. Levi is certainly a fan-favorite character, because of the fact that he&#039;s cool, overpowered, badass, kind-in-the-heart, smart, straight-to-the-point, and most of all, hilarious with all his neat-freakiness. The main character, Eren Yeager is strong-hearted, and &quot;special&quot;, but he&#039;s still not strong enough to defeat the titans. How he develops is one of the most interesting things, in this interesting-things-packed anime. <br />
<br />
The art and music can be described in one word: WOW! The art drawings were absolutely stunning! From the characters/titans to the setting of the story to all the equipment used in battle. The characters all had a unique aspect to them. The settings of the anime were beautiful. The cities, and walls looked realistic, the plains that characters dreamed of seeing made me want to run outside to see for myself how beautiful nature really is, and how humans under appreciate the naturality of nature. The 3-D gear was something that really caught my eye, and will certainly catch other people&#039;s eyes as well. A new form of action that&#039;s never been seen before. The characters would literally fly from rooftop to rooftop slicing their swords at the titans at high-speeds that keep the viewers eyes locked onto the screen at all times. The soundtrack in the anime was epic as shit. The openings speak for themselves, they do the anime justice. The openings were epic and certainly set the mood of what was to come from the anime. &quot;They&#039;re the prey, and we are the hunters!&quot; The rest of the soundtrack in the anime was okayasgduyasgda AMAZING. How can one describe how amazing those German OSTs were. They fit in perfectly with the epicness of the anime, and certianly added tons of suspense to the 3-D maneuver gear action. <br />
<br />
Of course, I may be over-thinking things, but the anime certainly included some themes while creating this masterpiece of an anime. The aspect of being confined in an area, doing the same daily routine every day. People seek to be free, and to seek adventure. Watch for this. Another theme that the anime incorporated was that of the cycle of life. Humans, we steal animals away from their families, we kill them, we eat them. What&#039;s so different from us, and the titans? The feelings of not being at the top of the food chain... Anyways, if you haven&#039;t already watched this anime and you&#039;re reading this review, then you&#039;ve clearly been living under a rock all this time, and I definitely encourage you to watch this show even if it isn&#039;t your style of anime.

				<b>Deep and Engaging Story, Great Characters, and Amazing Animation.</b><br/>
				Well I've read the manga a while ago, but never did I think it would get an anime adaptation this awesome.<br />
<br />Story 10/10: Although it does have a few cliches seen in many shonen, it is otherwise completely original, suspenseful and will have you on the edge of your seat every episode. Assuming the anime follows the manga faithfully, you are all in for many incredible twists!!!! Look forward for it, I can't wait.

<br />Characters 10/10: Although only 2 episodes have been released, the character development is incredible. The 3 main characters should and most likely will be fleshed out wonderfully in the anime (if going by the manga), their back-stories are quite good/surprising/original.<br />
<br />Animation 10/10: What more is there to say?<br /><br />Overall: This anime will most likely be the best of the season, it certainly had the best first episode of any anime I've watched, and there's no doubt production values will be on the high side. Here's hoping for another season after the first 25 episodes! Enjoy watching, it won't disappoint.
