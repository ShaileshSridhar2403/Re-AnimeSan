            <score>10/10 </br><br/><reviewer>Them Anime</reviewer></score>
            <p>The lack of fandom surrounding Hunter X Hunter is somewhat enigmatic to me. It is a title that, by all rights, should have a huge buzz behind it. Not only is Hunter X Hunter the work of Yoshihiro Togashi, the creator of Yu Yu Hakusho, but it is also far superior to other currently running big-hype titles, the most prominent of which is Naruto. It manages to be enormously entertaining through its unique concoction of animation, characterization, and plot, without resorting to the cliches that have all too often ruined a seemingly novel show of a similar vein. And yet Hunter X Hunter remains little known. With any luck this review will have a hand in lifting the veil of obscurity that currently surrounds this magnificent title.</p>
            <p>To begin with, the story of Hunter X Hunter is vibrant and imaginative, though not at all difficult. Right from the start the aim of this series is made clear, the eventual reunion of Gon with his father. However, the path that is taken to achieve this end is full of twists and turns that continuously succeed in keeping this tale fresh. The viewer is ceaselessly wisked between offbeat situations as varied as the dangerous wilderness to a battle-stage tower with over two hundred floors of increasingly difficult fighting tournaments. It is through these atypical situations that we come to understand the motivations of our lead and become endeared to his cause. A superb level of attention in plotting is also dedicated to the other prominent cast members, including Gon's companions Killua, Leorio, and Kurapica. Though the centerpiece here is Gon, none of the supporting roles go underdeveloped. In fact the only problem with plotting is that the story takes a few episodes to really get churning. If you can make it to about episode six or seven though, you will be fully strapped in for one hell of a fun ride.</p>
            <p>
                A rather unexpected facet of this title is how lightly the plot focuses on fighting, especially given that Togashi’s most famous work, Yu Yu Hakusho, was often little more than a continuous battle-fest. To be certain, fighting does take place and at some points in the series it becomes quite prominent, but it never manages to wrestle the spotlight away from the fleshier portions of the narrative. Despite this, the action leaves very little to be desired. The fight-action sets here are more complex than the typical ki-blasting, as fast-as-light-movement farce that has become the industry standard for fighting anime. Instead we are treated to a truly creative power-leveling system and a diversity of combat styles that make each fight more than simply diversionary but instead truly engaging. It is as if the battle scenes have actually added to the tension and excitement of the plotline rather than flattened it, a rare occurrence indeed.
            </p>
            <p>Leaving just a bit more to be desired of Hunter X Hunter, however, are the peripherals. Musically, while not bad, HXH just does not manage to live up to its more palatial qualities. Still, the music is good enough and has continuously improved throughout the series. I have personally enjoyed the opening and closing music more and more with each successive theme change that occurs. Additionally the animation is mostly quite nice. It certainly isn’t spectacular by any stretch of the imagination, but it is visually appealing. There is also a definite change for the better in terms of animation the further one progresses through the show. The set pieces have strong appeal as well, and are reasonably effective at immersing us in this strange and phenomenal world.</p>
            <p>The most remarkable aspect of Hunter X Hunter, however, lies within its remarkable characters. Most of the cast here is not at all generic or formulaic, a welcome retreat from the chiefly derivative characters so prominent in similar shows. Gon, the show’s lead, is a charismatic young boy whose optimism and innocence is always invigorating without being imposing. An odd tidbit, Gon is virtually never the strongest character on the screen, by a long shot. A partial reason for this is that his goal isn’t necessarily to be the strongest being in existence but primarily to better himself. This is another big plus in the personality department that sets Gon apart from your conventional “Shonen Jump Hero Archtype”. Gon’s optimism is offset well by the darker, more brooding persona of Killua, a young boy that Gon befriends early in the show. Together they make for perhaps the most interesting pair of best friends in all of anime. Their companions, Leorio and Kurapica, also make for complex and interesting characters. Leorio is a man who, haunted by his past, is motivated to the performance of benevolent acts to the benefit of humanity. Kurapica, conversely, is motivated by revenge, though revenge is an ideal that is out of character for him. Consequently, Kurapica always seems to be a man at odds with himself. Equally compelling are the more contemptible figures of this tale such as Hisoka, Kuroro, and the rest of the Genei Ryodan. The interplay of these vastly different personalities is the bread and butter of Hunter X Hunter.</p>
            <p>It should be no secret that Hunter X Hunter has bewitched me. Beyond some very minor failings, it is nearly beyond fault. It carries with it a sort of energy and charm that is very intoxicating. To put it most concisely, Hunter X Hunter should be considered Yoshihiro Togashi’s new masterwork. Any less firm a designation would be an injustice against this superb animated opus.</p>

            <score>10/10 </br><br/><reviewer>IGN</reviewer></score>
            <p>I should probably make it clear that I have watched the entire original series as well as staying current with the manga. So to put it bluntly, Hunter x Hunter (2011) is full of "Good". The characters are introduced very well early on in the series and they show extremely balanced character development as the series progresses. This is a great anime to get in to if you have reached that point where every anime nowadays feels stale and contains nothing but fanservice.</p>
            <p>In my honest opinion, Hunter x Hunter (2011) sets itself apart due to the way it presents itself in a classic Shounen fashion rather than trying to be "different", "edgy", and "daring". The irony about this is that the characters are some of the most original characters I've seen in any anime. For an anime that stays safely within the boundaries to have such original and daring characters make Hunter x Hunter (2011) one of the most unique and most must-see anime in the last 12 years.</p>
            <p>One of the things that Hunter x Hunter (2011) does best is the deception of the opening theme sequences compared to the anime itself. Many people including myself have considered the opening themes to be somewhat childish. What I mean by that statement is that the things you see in the anime are FAR different from what you may have imagined based on the opening sequences. This unique style allows the anime to take the viewer by surprise and makes it easier to hook them. This is the goal that all anime try to accomplish but very few have ever done.</p>
            <p>Despite Hunter x Hunter (2011)'s Shounen premise, there are only a few fights that deal with pure fighting. A lot of the fights are largely based on strategy and intelligence rather than relying on pure physical strength and ability. That does not imply that this is the focus of the anime or that it may be boring. The fights are generally interesting and very eventful while also showcasing different sides of the character other than just their physical strength and abilities. This is a very good way to maintain balance throughout the anime as well as keeping the viewers hooked.</p>
            <p>Comedy is another major aspect of this anime though it isn't the focus of the anime either. The main characters tend to have many comical moments throughout the series which serve as relief to many of the serious moments. The comedic relief that the characters provide is one of the many things that hook the viewers and continuously keep them hooked. While the comedy may not be the focus of the anime, it is a large enough aspect to say that it is one of the selling points for Hunter x Hunter (2011).</p>
            <p>I'd like to be completely honest here. There will be no bad section in my review of Hunter x Hunter (2011). I have absolutely nothing to write about this anime due simply to the fact that Hunter x Hunter (2011) is the closest thing to perfection that you may ever find in the anime world.</p>
            <p>I found the story to be incredibly simple while maintaining that "more than meets the eye" appearance. The characters are truly flawless in my opinion. They are charming yet have a deep and emotional feel to them. I really enjoyed the OST due to it's simplicity combined with a certain charm that you seldom see in very many anime of this caliber. I understand that some people find certain songs of the OST to be childish, but that is truly the charm that I'm talking about with this anime.</p>
            <p>There's also the fact that the character themes fit very well with the characters themselves. In many anime you will find character themes that don't really seem to match the "character". That is not the case with Hunter x Hunter (2011). Every song, whether it be the character themes or battle themes, fits flawlessly with the anime.</p>

            <p><b>HUNTER x HUNTER (2011)</b> (the x is silent) is a very successful shonen series and possibly one of the greatest anime to ever be created. I recommend it to everyone, regardless of whether you&rsquo;re a newcomer or a veteran when it comes to watching anime - if you haven&rsquo;t seen <i>HxH </i>yet, you should definitely start watching right away, because otherwise you will miss out on one of the most epic and entertaining shonen adventures out there.</p><p>The 2011 <i>Hunter x Hunter</i> anime so far consists of 148 episodes; it is currently unclear whether production will be resumed or not. The 2011 version is a remake of the 1999 anime of the same name, which consists of 62 Episodes. The manga is ongoing but currently on hiatus, and features 34 volumes &aacute; 360 chapters
as of July 2016.<br></p><p>I first discovered <i>Hunter x Hunter</i> when I was looking online for recommendations for what to watch after I finished <i>Bleach </i>(which I loved). <i>HxH</i> was widely recommended as one of the best works of art to exist. Since I was looking for an anime to match up to the great experience I had with Bleach, I started watching with rather high expectations, and I must say, <i>HxH </i>has definitely managed to deliver. <br></p><p><i>Hunter x Hunter 2011</i> is, since I first watched it up until today, my most favorite anime out of all I&rsquo;ve seen so far.</p><hr><p><br><b>SUMMARY</b><br>The story follows 12-year-old Gon, who is eager to become a hunter just like his father used to be. Hunters are adept adventurers that excell in various skills such as trapping beasts, hunting for treasures, discovering the untouched wilderness, or facing various opponents in combat. Along his journey, Gon befriends Killua, 12, an assassin, Kurapica, 14, who is seeking to revenge his clan, and Leorio, 18, who strives to become a doctor. Together they take part in the infamous Hunter Exam, not knowing that this will just be the beginning of a series of captivating, dangerous and fun adventures.</p><hr><p><br><b>STORY - 10<br></b>The exam, the Heaven&rsquo;s Arena, the Phantom Troupe, Greed Island, the
Chimaera Ants, the Election - <i>Hunter x Hunter</i> definitely
provides one of the most diverse plots I have ever happened to watch.
There is something for everybody - engaging fighting tournaments,
international war and politics, crime, and even virtual reality are
only some major topics in the anime.
<i><br></i></p><p><i>HxH</i> appears
light-hearted and sweet at times, sporting almost childlike humour
and plenty of comic relief, yet its mood changes quickly to a very
dark, mystical and obscure one that will keep you engaged. But not
only is the story highly entertaining, suspenseful, relatable and
beautiful, but also very well thought out and outstandingly written
and presented. <br></p><p>What I liked most about
the entire series was the way the events were being narrated - during
important events, there is a third-person-narrator providing insight
into the characters&rsquo; minds, offers explanations about powers,
abilities and world-building, perfectly outlines events and connects
different storylines. This is revolutionary to me, something I have
never witnessed with any other anime so far, and I applaud the
producers for making such a smart choice as to interpreting such a
very text-heavy manga. As happens often in (shonen) anime there are
so many aspects the viewer needs explanations for, and mostly it is
done via e.g. letting the character explain their power to another
character or their opponent, which often seems staged, unrealistic
and unreasonable. With <i>HxH</i>, this problem is skillfully
eliminated.</p><p>Furthermore, I had the
feeling of reading a captivating book as opposed to watching an anime
on screen, which I really enjoyed. The dialogues between the
characters are always meaningful yet funny, you gain quick insight to
every main and secondary character&rsquo;s personal traits and quirks,
and the story sticks to a clearly recognisable golden thread which
makes it very easy to follow.</p><p>The single arcs (there are
7 in the anime so far) are all equally interesting and blend in well
with each other. Plot twists and unforseen developments never fall
short, and the pacing is exquisite - not once did I feel bored with a
certain plot, or had the feeling something was being rushed. The
pacing allows every main and secondary character sufficient screen
time, leaves plenty of room for character development, and is
generally easy to keep pace with.</p><p>Another major plus for <i>HxH</i>
is the ability and power system - every living being posesses a spiritual aura called Nen (comparable to Reiatsu, Ki, Chakra, etc.)
which can be developed into a dangerous weapon through hard physical
and mental training, and plenty of practice. Nen users can be divided
into 6 sub-categories that each entail a very unique way of
manipulating aura. It is entirely up to the Nen user to think of and
built up unique techniques - like this, almost everything is
possible. <br></p><p>Providing such a broad
variety of possible fighting abilities, the battles and development
of power never get boring. It is enthralling to watch Gon and his
friends master Nen and later their unique skills, and eventually put
them to good use in magnificent fights against their opponents. What
I always consider important with power-ups is the traceability - is
the way abilities are gained and enhanced reasonable, or does it feel
like they&rsquo;re made up out of thin air (the infamous &ldquo;asspull&rdquo; or
&ldquo;deus ex machina&rdquo;)? Regarding <i>HxH</i>, it definitely is the
former - power-ups are mostly gained through hard work, continous
practice, and learning from faliure; they&rsquo;re not just simply
bestowed upon the heroes, which I think is very realistic.</p><p>The realism is another
factor I consider positive. Not only the power system mentioned
above, but basically every single aspect of the anime feels real and
logical. The fights are mostly unpredictable because it is never sure
which party will win. Gon, the main character, fails just as much as
everybody else, and it always depends on strength, team work,
strategy and intellect who emerges as the winner in the end. Nakama
power is, of course, important, but not something that will save your
life in an actual fight to the death.</p><p><b>IN GENERAL</b> - <i>Hunter
x Hunter</i> will provide you with a diverse plot, a well-presented
and engaging story, a more realistic power- and fighting-system than
most other shonen anime, and it will easily keep you engaged with its
humour, obscurity, suspense and relatability.<b><br></b></p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="414" data-orig-width="736"><img data-orig-height="414" data-orig-width="736" alt="image" src="http://78.media.tumblr.com/bfc6afc0d87f4d6df6bd1c18229023b5/tumblr_inline_oa41p8WSNG1tb9osa_1280.png" width="700" height="393"></figure><p><b><br>CHARACTERS
- 10</b><br>Of course the characters are what makes or breaks an
anime. With <i>HxH</i>, the diverse set of main and secondary characters
definitely adds to its overall outstanding appearance.</p><p>First of all, there are
our four main heroes - Gon, Killua, Kurapica and Leorio, who couldn&rsquo;t
be any more different from each other but nevertheless make for a
great team. The dynamics between the four of them are hilariously
funny to watch yet at the same time relatable and heartwarming. Their
bond, to me, is the definition of true friendship - they will always
stick together, stand up for and support each other unconditionally,
while at the same time giving each other space and the freedom to act
after their own morals and values. With me it&rsquo;s a rarity, being so
fond of main characters, but you just can&rsquo;t help falling in love
with Gon and his friends.</p><p>The secondary characters
are, just as much as the main cast, a standout. You quickly gain
insight into all characters different personalities, goals and pasts,
which are equally as interesting and obscure as the main characters&rsquo;,
and find yourself rooting for minor characters in no time. Their back
stories, abilities and traits of character are well thought out and
relate to the main storyline. Furthermore, I consider the amount of
screentime given to each character highly appropriate, and found
myself thoroughly enjoying every single character&rsquo;s development.</p><p>As for the villains, I
couldn&rsquo;t have been any more pleased. There is Hisoka the Magician,
which poses as the main antagonist for most of the series, and I can
but say that he is one of the most shady, obscure and engaging
personalities I&rsquo;ve ever seen in anime. Little is known about his
past, and his motives seem both disconcerting and intriguing; he is
sinister and evil yet at the same time congenial and charming. Same
goes for Kuroro Lucifer and Illumi Zoldyck; these three are, by far,
my favourite characters in <i>HxH</i>, even beating the main cast at
that.
</p><p>Other standout characters
in my opinion are for example: Meruem and Komugi, Kaito, Morel and
Knov, Pariston, Nobunaga, Zenritsu/Melody and (of course) Netero. I
could go on and on.</p><p><b>IN GENERAL</b> - there
is no chance you won&rsquo;t be engaged by <i>Hunter x Hunter</i>&rsquo;s
broad variety of well-developed, loveable and interesting characters.</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="527" data-orig-width="943"><img data-orig-height="527" data-orig-width="943" alt="image" src="http://78.media.tumblr.com/75142b328b757f99fa5c3e3544e3b9d7/tumblr_inline_oa41qkttn31tb9osa_1280.png" width="700" height="391"></figure><p><b><br>ART - 10</b><br>I
enjoyed the artstyle, character design and animation of HxH very
much, the 2011 version looks polished, modern and simply beautiful to
me. Togashi&rsquo;s style of drawing both humans and animals is very
unique and slightly quirky. I especially like the way he draws
characters that are not classically pretty or handsome (e.g.
Zenritsu). Overall <i>HxH</i>&rsquo;s appearance is colourful and happy, yet
very dark at times, so it nicely matches the general mood(-swings) of
the anime.</p><p>For the character design I
can only applaud Togashi; each character has a very unique look to
them that not only makes them stand out as visually highly appealing,
but also adds to their overall persona and often perfectly lines up
with their traits. I also found the fact that Killua, very
fashionably, keeps changing outfits while all other characters firmly
stick to their style of dressing and only sometimes make minor
changes to their apparel, quite humorous.</p><p>The sceneries shown in the
series easily match up with the character design; they are stunning
and phantastical; plenty of times I wished I could visit the places
Gon and the others were exploring.</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="535" data-orig-width="959"><img data-orig-height="535" data-orig-width="959" alt="image" src="http://78.media.tumblr.com/d49d2bf9f68040976c6a082bedb9cdc1/tumblr_inline_oa41rlGciJ1tb9osa_1280.png" width="700" height="390"></figure><p><b><br>MUSIC -
10</b><br>What I think is most important when it comes to background
music in anime, is simply that it matches and enhances the overall
mood of the series. This, and even more, is definitely the case with
<i>HxH</i>. I don&rsquo;t have any complaints at all regarding both the
beautiful, classical Original Soundtrack and the more current
openings / endings. As it generally is with <i>HxH</i>, the mood greatly
varies, and so does the music - no matter what music you prefer, you
will most likely find something you like in the OSTs.</p><p><b>IF YOU&rsquo;RE INTERESTED</b>
- or simply want a nice overview of the music in HxH, i recommend
looking up the following OSTs and Openings/Endings:
</p><p>- <i>To give a Marionette
Life</i><br>- <i>Riot</i><br>- <i>In the Palace</i><br>- <i>Legend of
the Martial Artist</i><br>- <i>Kaze no Uta </i>(performed by <i>Motoda
Minako</i>)<br>- <i>Departure!</i> (Opening 1, performed by <i>Ono
Masatoshi</i>)<br>- <i>Just awake</i> (Ending 1, performed by <i>Fear,
and Loathing in Las Vegas</i>)<br>- <i>Reason</i> (Ending 3,
performed by <i>Yuzu</i>)</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="577" data-orig-width="1024"><img data-orig-height="577" data-orig-width="1024" alt="image" src="http://78.media.tumblr.com/d2e549ad2bd88629f37a9707750ecbd3/tumblr_inline_oa41skresf1tb9osa_1280.png" width="700" height="394"></figure><p><b><br>OVERALL
ENJOYMENT - 10</b><br>Hunter x Hunter is, to me, the one anime I
enjoyed watching the most by far, as is probably evident judging from
the exceptional rating. It will probably be the only one to ever
achieve a perfect 10, regarding all the criteria I&rsquo;m judging from.
This certainly is a matter of taste, but I will dare to say I&rsquo;m
about 99% sure you will love <i>Hunter x Hunter</i> just as much as I do
after watching it. You will be hooked after the first few episodes
and continue enjoying it thoroughly until the (momentary) end.</p><p>So what are you still waiting for? <br></p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="411" data-orig-width="734"><img data-orig-height="411" data-orig-width="734" alt="image" src="http://78.media.tumblr.com/766ea433e8a1b39c5d42d75f30ead1e2/tumblr_inline_oa41td9xXd1tb9osa_1280.png" width="700" height="391"></figure><p><b>PROS</b>:&nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;				 <b>CONS:</b><br>+ Captivating, diverse
