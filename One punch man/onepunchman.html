        The seemingly ordinary and unimpressive Saitama has a rather unique hobby: being a hero. In order to pursue his childhood dream, he trained relentlessly for three years—and lost all of his hair in the process. Now, Saitama is incredibly powerful, so much so that no enemy is able to defeat him in battle. In fact, all it takes to defeat evildoers with just one punch has led to an unexpected problem—he is no longer able to enjoy the thrill of battling and has become quite bored.
        <br /><br />This all changes with the arrival of Genos, a 19-year-old cyborg, who wishes to be Saitama's disciple after seeing what he is capable of. Genos proposes that the two join the Hero Association in order to become certified heroes that will be recognized for their positive contributions to society, and Saitama, shocked that no one knows who he is, quickly agrees. And thus begins the story of One Punch Man, an action-comedy that follows an eccentric individual who longs to fight strong enemies that can hopefully give him the excitement he once felt and just maybe, he'll become popular in the process.

            <p>One Punch Man is an anime/manga/web-comic about a superhero so powerful he can end any fight with one punch. It's the best. I am going to try my best to explain why. But the truth is -- I don't really understand it myself.</p>
            <p>Like any good anime hero, I'll do my best. Ganbare Yo!<!--more--></p>
            <p>Halfway through the second episode of One Punch Man there's a pivotal scene. </p>
            <p>Our bald protagonist Saitama listens to Genos, his Cyborg sidekick, reveal his reasons for becoming a superhero. Exposition central. The swirling music spirals, his tragic backstory is revealed: line after line after line of cliche-ridden dialogue. </p>
            <p>I've watched scenes like this before, we all have -- in Bleach, in Naruto, in Hajime No Ippo, in... well, take your pick really. Every Shonen manga/anime ever made has a scene like this. But in One Punch Man it's different.<!--more--></p>
            <p>This time the protagonist isn't sombre, understanding. Quite the opposite. Saitama's face contorts into a grimace. He is bored, much like the audience. Stop talking. Stop talking. Bloody hell, stop talking!</p>
            <p>Genos will not stop talking. Saitama's face gets worse. The exposition gets worse. </p>
            <p>Eventually Saitama explodes! Enough is enough, no more of this backstory bullshit. 20 words or less! </p>
            <p>20 words or less goddammit!</p>
            <div class="media_wrap image xlarge center"><a href="https://edge.alluremedia.com.au/m/k/2016/01/10words.jpg" rel="modal"><img src="review1_1.webp" class="size_xlarge" alt="" /></a></div>
            <p>This is the joke -- this One Punch Man's one joke, essentially. But holy shit is it a good joke. </p>
            <p>If, like me, you've read a bunch of manga or watched way too much anime, you understand the satire. You've watched many a sidekick, many a super villain spend 50% of an episode bearing his soul. "I'm only evil/powerful because a ninja/robot/pirate/monster killed my parents/brother/family and now I'm out to be strong/get revenge/kill bad guys." You understand how deep rooted that cliche really is.</p>
            <p>One Punch Man says no. One Punch Man says 20 words or less. </p>
            <p>One Punch Man's joke is that it subverts everything. Nothing else is important. Kotaku Australia ran a review of One Punch Man, it was a very good review -- a positive review in fact -- but it <em>kinda</em> missed the point. It broke One Punch Man down into different parts, criticised the lack of drama, the fact that the battles have no tension because the protagonist can end all battles -- as the title informs us -- with One Punch. </p>
            <p>But um... that's the joke!</p>
            <p>That's the joke. That's arguably the <em>one</em> joke, but One Punch Man is utterly incredible at telling that one joke and continually finds new ways to tell that joke. </p>
            <p>Here's how the joke works: Saitama approaches an enemy. That enemy discusses his power, his years of training, his reasons for going down the path of evil. Oh my God, could this be the one, the audience asks -- the enemy that finally cause Saitama to break a sweat.</p>
            <p>Bam. One Punch. Nope. </p>
            <p>Next!</p>
            <p>How many times have we watched mangas and anime develop a weird obsession with that same old shit: power levels, endless training arcs, endless fights with zero consequence that make absolutely no sense whatsoever. Fights that end in stalemates, fights that drag out for episode after episode, fights with flashbacks. Jesus wept...</p>
            <p>Bam. One Punch. Nope.</p>
            <p>Next. </p>
            <p>It's incredible. It's an incredible joke, and it has layers.</p>
            <p>Shonen Manga -- you know the story, you know the drill. The hero has to work hard. Hard work beats talent. "I WILL NEVER GIVE UP." "GANBARE YO!" Success comes from training, from training <em>arcs</em> to be more specific. Naruto, for example, learns his Rasengan through the force of sheer will and uses it to defeat a previously unbeatable enemy. That's not how One Punch Man works.</p>
            <p>Another perfect scene:</p>
            <p>Saitama's sidekick Genos watches as another seemingly unbeatable enemy falls with one punch. Genos begs Saitama -- how did he acquire this power, this strength? Dramatic pause, I will finally reveal to you my secret training, says Saitama.</p>

            <p>100 push ups, 100 sit ups, 100 squats, 10 kilometre run. Every single day!</p>
            <p>The sheer beauty of it -- Saitama thinks this regime is super hard. He thinks he is undergoing the type of training you might see in Naruto, Dragon Ball Z or Bleach, but it's just a... regular training session. Pure genius.</p>
            <p>It's just a joke that sort of rips the carpet from underneath and I don't know why, but it never really stops being funny. </p>
            <p>One Punch Man is funny I think, because of how cliche-ridden Shonen manga is -- how dependent it is on certain plot structures, certain character types. Place a truly original character like Saitama into that universe and literally everything he does is funny. His mere presence in this space is satirical. It's incredible because it's so simple, but it works.</p>
            <p>The joke -- Saitama's overwhelming, stupid strength levels -- it just works. And after years of being completely bored with anime, its just so much fun to watch as One Punch Man tears it all to shreds. </p>

            <score>10/10</br><br/><reviewer>Black Nerd Problems</reviewer></score>
            <p>This article needs no introduction. You know what <em>One-Punch Man</em> is, and if not then you better recognize, son. That intro was 20 words or less (a joke you&#8217;ll only get if you&#8217;ve seen the show). Anyway, this will be an extensive review of <em>One-Punch Man</em> and why it&#8217;s amazing. Oh, spoiler alert, I think the show is amazing. There will be no plot spoilers in this review, so if you haven&#8217;t been blessed by this anime yet don&#8217;t worry, this review won&#8217;t reveal any secrets. Anyway, let&#8217;s get started.</p>
            <p><em>One-Punch Man</em> is a 12-episode anime series based on the manga and webcomic of the same name. The anime was picked up by the animation studio Madhouse, a powerhouse in the anime industry. They were the studio behind <em>Trigun,</em> <em>Black Lagoon,</em> part of <em>Hellsing Ultimate,</em> <em>Summer Wars,</em> <em>Hajime No Ippo,</em> even <em>Beyblade</em> believe it or not. There are tons of other shows that they&#8217;ve animated. They all look beautiful but the studio goes all out for <em>One-Punch Man.</em> Every single frame of animation in this show has so much care put into it. Different artists and animators worked on different scenes so an episode can have a different feel with each scene which just adds to the overall magic.</p>
            <p><img class="img-responsive aligncenter" src="review2_1.gif" alt="" /></p>
            <p>This show has so much character in it that the animation has to be on point to fully bring out the script and Madhouse definitely knew that when they were doing their thing. The art style does a great job with every single detail, making each villain look cool and sometimes creepy with how detailed they are. It allows each character to fully express themselves and makes each villain look and feel imposing with their animation and style. In terms of looks <em>One-Punch Man</em> is just about perfect.</p>
            <p><img class="img-responsive aligncenter" src="review2_2.gif" alt="" /></p>
            <p>Let&#8217;s move on to the sound and voice acting. The opening theme is as hype as you would want it to be. The soundtrack feels like a superhero show with inspiring tracks that make you literally want to punch something, to slower tracks that will help you get through the toughest exam days. It&#8217;s very well done in general as the music has to be amazing to provide background for the animation. The soundtrack does exactly what it&#8217;s meant to do and goes to infinity and beyond with what it brings to the table.</p>
            <p>Now the voice acting, oh man, the voice acting. Every single villain has that amazing condescending voice that all the old-school anime villains had and they go all out with it. The gloating and the laughing that the voice actors use to express their villainy is second to none and each villain has the aura of a Final Boss, that culminates in a comedic payoff in their fight with the main character. Speaking of main characters, their voice acting is amazing as well with great timing and little nuances in their voices that really bring them to life. Saitama&#8217;s voice matches his personality and character so well that it feels like the character was made for that voice actor. Every voice fits every character and the emotions are brought to life extremely well.</p>
            <p><img class="img-responsive aligncenter" src="review2_3.gif" alt="" /></p>
            <p><em>One-Punch Man</em> follows Saitama, a bald dude who trained so hard he lost his hair and beats everyone with one punch, and Genos, a cyborg who wants Saitama to be his master and train him. They are the center of the narrative and they make a great pair. There are other characters but I guarantee that your favorite will be a different character who&#8217;s in the show for about 1 or 2 episodes. I GUARANTEE he will be your favorite by the time the show is over and if he isn&#8217;t then you need to look deep in your soul and find out what&#8217;s clouding your judgement. All jokes aside the characters are all unique in their own way and the way they handle villains and other situations will give you a different view of the world they live in.</p><div class='mailmunch-forms-in-post-middle' style='display: none !important;'></div>

            <p>The action and comedy blend together seamlessly and flow like a water bender throughout the 12 episodes. It takes the tropes of typical Shōnen anime shows and literally punches a hole through them. Saitama&#8217;s voice and facial expressions really stick out from the other characters and allow him to be even more special than he already is. The way he reacts to villain monologues or power ups is a sight to behold and it never gets old. Genos is more like your stereotypical Shōnen action hero. His moves are flashy and he usually takes a lot of damage from the villains. You could say he&#8217;s there to give some of them a fair fight.</p>
            <p>The action sequences with Genos are breathtaking sometimes and will leave you with your mouth wide open. Saitama and Genos are almost exact opposites in terms of their attitudes and as the show goes on they grow to understand each other and even admire certain aspects of the other. Saitama is a hero and Genos just wants to bask in his light even if no one else will.</p>
            <p><img class="img-responsive aligncenter" src="review2_4.gif" alt="" /></p>
            <p><em>One-Punch Man</em> was great in all aspects. The animation, the music, and the characters are all on point. The fact that Saitama is the strongest person and can defeat everyone in one punch might be the show&#8217;s selling point, but that&#8217;s not what will keep you hooked. The way they use the fact that he can do that, the fact that he IS the strongest, the fact that he truly just wants to be a hero because it&#8217;s the right thing to do, that&#8217;s what will keep you wanting more. The journey of Saitama is just beginning because there will be a season 2 and if it&#8217;s even half as good as the first season then we&#8217;ll probably have another Anime of the Year. Don&#8217;t forget to watch the OVA&#8217;s after you&#8217;re done with the 12 episodes!</p>

            There are only two types of people in the world: one who absolutely love One Punch Man, and other who strongly dislike it for being too predictable. Now finally that the anime is over, I can review it properly. <br />
<br />
<br />
Story: 8/10<br />
One Punch Man is an action-comedy anime which tells a story about a man named Saitama who is &#039;a hero just for fun&#039; in a world where monsters and heroes are quite common. He is quite overpowered and manages to kill anyone in just a single punch, which has made his life quite boring. Soon a new cyborg named Genos is introduced who is in


    search for another robot who destroyed his village and he later requests Saitama to become his master after seeing his strength.<br />
    At first the story sounds quite predictable and the idea of killing anyone in a single punch adds more to it. Yes, it&#039;s true! It becomes a little predictable and the humor of killing anyone in a single punch dies off quickly. But the anime doesn&#039;t has only that much to offer. The story starts developing from 5th episode with the introduction of Hero Association and a ranking system which classifies heroes into C class, B class, A class and S class having rankings in each class. New characters are introduced and the story becomes more interesting. The last two arcs were very good, so just don&#039;t drop the anime in your early episodes thinking that it&#039;s getting predictable or is not worth watching.<br />
    <br />
    <br />
    Art: 10/10<br />
    This is the best element of One Punch Man! The art of this anime is fabulous. Madhouse has again done a wonderful job. The backgrounds are really well done and the fighting scenes are amazing. Infact One Punch Man and Fate/Zero are the best graphics anime I have seen in my life! One Punch Man is actually a pretty average budget anime. The secret behind One Punch Man&#039;s amazing graphics lies behind the fact that it has been directed by Shingo Natsume (Key animator of Gurren Lagann, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, Hachimitsu to Clover), assisting Kazuya Murata and with the legendary Kenichi Konishi supervising the animation, Sejoon Kim (animator of Gundam) as a regular animation director. Another notable element of One-Punch Man&#039;s visuals is the digital animation, something also tied to Natsume&#039;s presence. Other than the animation staff, there is someone else who deserves special credit. People who have read Yusuke Murata&#039;s version of One-Punch Man – the one the anime is based on – know that even before the anime, the series already was animated. Sort of. Sometimes rather arbitrarily, Murata would go on to draw sequences step-by-step with a ridiculous level of detail, almost as if they were key animation sheets. Something he is capable of putting off because he&#039;s an exceptional and dedicated artist, but also because he is a fan of animation.<br />
    <br />
    <br />
    Sound: 10/10<br />
    Another element of One Punch Man which makes the show amazing! Opening and Ending song, both are wonderful. I keep listening to both of them over and over again because they are that awesome. All the OSTs are also worth listening to, and some are just superb which may give you goosebumps! Voice acting is also top notch. Many talented voice actors like Miyano Mamoru, Sawashiro Miyuki, Kaji Yuki, Sakurai Takahiro, Nakamura Yuuichi, Hayami Saori, Namikawa Daisuke etc are there and they have done a great job.<br />
    <br />
    <br />
    Character: 10/10<br />
    All the characters are quite likeable. They have unique personalities and possess a unique charm in themselves. <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    I will write a few words on my (and people&#039;s) most favorite characters from One Punch Man:<br />
    <br />
    1. Saitama - Our favorite hero, the protagonist of the show, quite humorous.<br />
    <br />
    2. Genos - Saitama&#039;s partner, best disciple, cyborg and cool. <br />
    <br />
    3. Mumen Rider - C class hardworking hero who rides a cycle but is physically pretty weak to fight with monsters but is very courageous and hardworking/<br />
    <br />
    4. Sonic - A ninja! What more? Everybody likes ninjas (Naruto haters please keep it low! -_-)<br />
    <br />
    5. Tatsumaki? - You know what I am talking about if you have seen 11th episode of One Punch Man! ;) [If you still don&#039;t understand, let me know -_-&#039;]<br />
    <br />

    Enjoyment: 10/10<br />
    I really enjoyed One Punch Man because of it&#039;s intense action which were beautified by amazing graphics and coated with amazing soundtracks.<br />
    <br />
    <br />
    Overall: 9.6/10<br />
    If you like action-comedy (with frequent serious arcs), adventure and superpower anime, and elements like graphics and sound are an important factor for you then you MUST WATCH this anime! Even if you don&#039;t like all that, you can give it a try. I assure you that One Punch Man is NOT some random cliche anime which has random power boosts which makes it impossible to watch. It is quite entertaining.<br />
