            Painted in red, the word "VON" is all that is left behind after a terrorist attack on a nuclear facility in Japan. The government is shattered by their inability to act, and the police are left frantically searching for ways to crack down the perpetrators. The public are clueless—until, six months later, a strange video makes its way onto the internet. In it, two teenage boys who identify themselves only as "Sphinx" directly challenge the police, threatening to cause destruction and mayhem across Tokyo. Unable to stop the mass panic quickly spreading through the city and desperate for any leads in their investigation, the police struggle to act effectively against these terrorists, with Detective Kenjirou Shibazaki caught in the middle of it all.
            <br/><br/>Zankyou no Terror tells the story of Nine and Twelve, the two boys behind the masked figures of Sphinx. They should not exist, yet they stand strong in a world of deception and secrets while they make the city fall around them, all in the hopes of burying their own tragic truth..

I&#x27;ll start this review by saying I started watching this show with no
prior knowledge about the writers and the premise, so I had no idea
what to expect. What I found was a mature and compelling story that
kept me entertained throughout the season.<br>Even in such an amazing season, it managed to shine through as the
anime that defined the summer of 2014. Even compared against such great
shows as Gekkan shoujo, Tokyo Ghoul, and Aldnoah;Zero, Zankyou no
Terror stood on top.<br><br>Story: 9/10<br><br>There are many stories that focus on anti-heroes and terrorism, yet
none have come close to the level of maturity found in ZnT. This shows
succeeded in areas that other shows such as Death Note faltered. You
will find no edgy character development here; no shonen-esque elements.
This is the kind of show that you could quite happily show to any
non-anime orientated friends with confidence that they won&#x27;t leave
mid-way through, or that you will have to justify why so-and-so is
making unnecessary fan-service.<br><br>Art: 10/10<br><br>The art style of ZnT perfectly fits the tone of the show. There are
many still-life scenes in ZnT, and each one perfectly captures the
essence of Tokyo. After seeing Tokyo rendered in both Tokyo Ghoul and
Tokyo ESP, the realistic calming images in ZnT were a breath of fresh
air. <br><br>The character design also mirrors the art style: realistic enough to
provide a sense of severity, yet different enough to give the show an
underlying artistic element.<br><br>Despite some background characters lacking detail in some parts, this
is expected for the first release of an airing show and does no detract
from the overall excellence. <br><br>Sound: 10/10<br><br>There are very few shows in which I decide to buy the OST, and even
fewer in which I will continue to listen to the songs many weeks later.
These songs bear a strong resemblance to &#x27;songs from a cold country&#x27;
which is a phrase that will become clear if you watch ZnT. In short:
the sound is beautiful, elegant and very melancholic.<br><br>Character 9/10<br><br>Both 9 and 12 have starkly contrasting personalities: 9 being blunt and
mature with 12 being childish and playful. Lisa describers them as
having&#x27;a smile like the sun and eyes like ice&#x27;. However it goes far
deeper than that. Underneath 9&#x27;s calm exterior lies indescribable
grief, and under 12&#x27;s smile lies a form of severity to match 12s.<br><br>At this point many watchers would criticise Lisa fir being &#x27;bland&#x27; or
simply a plot device. However it is impossible to imagine the show
without her. Not only does she create a contrast, with her troubles
with her mother against 9 and 12 orphan statues, she shows a great deal
of development over the show&#x27;s progression.<br><br>Finally I will touch on the characters in the police force, and how ZnT
manages to capture adults in such an appropriate way. The police are
neither shown as mindless soldiers, nor as clumsy un-organised oafs,
and although the duo play along with them, the police are never
antagonised. <br><br>Enjoyment 8/10<br><br>From episode 1 I was hooked. Now that it is over I feel as if I have
gained something from the experience<br><br>To summarise, Zankyou no Terror is a high-quality Anime which I
recommend to all of you.

				Zankyou No Terror is not a show about terrorism. <br />
Before you roll your eyes and point your finger at the obvious “Terror” emblazoned in the title, I am serious on this one. While the topic is addressed at times, the crime thriller genre is merely a tool the show wields to sculpt out its socio-political commentary on Japan. If you are expecting a deep-seated exploration of the subject of terrorism, this show will not satisfy you. So please chuck those expectations into the trash and enjoy the show for what it is. Zankyou No Terror tells an engaging tale of generational conflicts, post-war nationalism, isolation from modern society and the hopeful rebellious spirit of youths.<br /><br />The story kicks off in a grounded, realistic setting of present day Tokyo. 2 teenage terrorists, who go by the names of Nine and Twelve blow up the Tokyo Metropolitan Government building, and in the process accidentally involves a girl called Lisa Mishima. Flashbacks reveal Nine and Twelve to have escaped from a mysterious institution when they were children, hence cloaking their motivations in mystery. From then on, the show continues its crime procedural routine that lasts for a few episodes: Nine and Twelve would plant a bomb, release a video on Youtube under the name ‘Sphinx’ and challenge the police to solve a given riddle before the next bomb explodes. All the riddles are based on the Greek tragedy Oedipus Rex, and interesting choice that gives the audience parallels to think about- especially the idea of patricide and sacrifice in the pursuit of truth. We also get introduced to Shibazaki, a detective who gets caught up in the cat and mouse game against Sphinx. He is a character whoe has been casted out from society just like Sphinx and Lisa. These first few episodes are thematically condensed and provide solid insights into modern society.<br />
<br />The characters of Zankyou No Terror are not complex, after all, the show is more thematically-focused as compared to being character-focused. Zankyou No Terror is not condoning the main characters’ acts of violence, rather, it wants the viewers to reflect about why they were forced into committing those acts.  The show does succeed in evoking the emotional depths of its main terrorist duo and Lisa: the need to escape from the clutches of modern society, the youthful drive to challenge the world that rejected them, the yearning for human connection. This would not have been possible without the brilliant aesthetics and production, which are definitely the show’s strongest point. The polished direction is among the best in recent memory, taking the viewing experience to a cinematic level at times. The show efficiently manipulates camera angles and colour palettes to heighten atmosphere, while the lighting frames the scenes purposefully, stirring up a sense of alienation. Yoko Kanno absolutely delivers when it comes to the Icelandic-inspired soundtrack- the music is a blend of acoustic and electronic that sets the mood perfectly, constantly evoking the melancholy felt by the characters. It brought in the pathos needed to execute the best moments of the show.<br />
<br />Of course the show is not without its faults, which mostly lie in the script. The show takes a generic popcorn thriller route at times, and when you have a show that is rooted in realism (even referencing Tor and virtual currency), many events ended up requiring suspension of disbelief, which might put off some viewers. This fault appeared with the introduction of the show’s antagonist, Five, an agent deployed by the U.S government. The intervention of the US highlighted the problematic relationship between Japan and U.S., but Five came off too cartoonish. As a childhood friend of Nine and Twelve from the mysterious institution, her abnormal upbringing might have been the reason for her hugely childish behavior, but she often went overboard with her dramatic theatrics. The setup of her plans were ridiculous and Hollywoodesque, which led to silly contrived scenarios that clashed with the tone of the show. When her arc came to a close, she was cast in a more humanized and sympathetic light, but her character did more harm than good to the show. Thankfully, the show picked up again afterwards, where it made an interesting choice in joining the narrative with the ongoing issue of Japan’s rising nationalism.  <br />
 <br />In spite of its shaky narrative, Zankyou No Terror is a show that presented relevant themes and concluded with an emotional ending. The show does not fully dig into its themes or answer the questions raised, but it articulates its reflections on society well and its best scenes are truly memorable and affecting. It is an ambitious and passionate production with plenty of substance to appreciate. <br />

				<p><b><span style="font-size:20px">The Highlights<span></b><br />
<b>Presentation:</b> Refreshingly logical and intense<br />
<b>Animation and Music:</b> Compliment each other perfectly<br />
<b>Characters:</b> Initially interesting though unsympathetic <br />
<b>Mystery:</b> Teeters towards underwhelming the more that is revealed</p>
<p><div align='center'><img  src="terror1.jpg" alt="" width="160" height="120" /> <img src="terror2.jpg" alt="" width="160" height="120" /> <img src="terror3.jpg" alt="" width="160" height="120" /></div></p>
<p>It probably goes without saying in the world of anime that Watanabe Shinichiro defines style. A master of making animation and music a single entity; where synergy is the prevailing element in Watanabe’s works, then what ascends him as a director it is his precision with detail that could piece together a shattered vase as if it were pristine. In <i>Cowboy Bebop</i></a>, it was a Tarantino-esque ability to blend genres, plots, and motifs. For <i>Terror in Resonance</i>, it is the thoroughness and detailing that goes into the scenario. The world unsettling tangible at times, he gave an intricate experience worth watching, less so, however and unfortunately, a story worth telling. </p>
<p>At <i>Terror</i>&#8216;s most engaging is the dance between the youths and the police. The methods of Sphinx may go beyond what even the brightest are capable on their own. But it is grounded almost entirely in actual contemporary criminal techniques whether online anonymity or explosive rigging. The riddles themselves, with solutions ranging from to gematria to existential prompts, often try credulity. However, they follow a logic which refreshingly exists beyond the mind of the writers. The payoff in the dance between Sphinx and the police becomes ever more satisfying as the genius extends beyond simply the direction. </p>
<p>But <i>Terror in Resonance</i> doesn&#8217;t just function like the actual 21st century, it feels it too. There is an underlying atmosphere of vulnerability, that even the slightest glimmer of openness or trustfulness puts everyone in jeopardy. This plus animation, a caliber of which I had once thought impossible on TV, makes it easy to forget at times that one is watching something drawn. More impressive, though by no means unexpected, is how each scene gels seamlessly with a refreshingly Icelandic inspired, soundtrack. I can no less believe that Kanno Yoko scored this anime to match the animation as I can that the animation was directed as such to fit the score. </p>
<p>Mentally satiating and visually absorbing as it is, it&#8217;s unfortunately hard not to feel an emotional disconnect to <i>Terror</i> overall, and our protagonists play a lot into the reason. Ability to limit collateral damage aside, little changes the fact that Nine and Twelve are unambiguously terrorists. I would assume we are expected to sympathize with enigmatic duo in light of this. This turns to be problematic, however, less because of their actions, and more due to the script doing little to make anyone particularly sympathetic. Were the two more loathsome or flamboyant, they could have been as compelling as other anti-heroes. But alas, everyone here is more or less blank and limited in terms of emotional range. The chess allusions throughout are rather apt since at best the cast are the scenario&#8217;s pawns.</p>
<p>Being said, it&#8217;s thus unfortunate that the realization and resolution come off as disproportionate to one another. At risk of spoiling, for an anime which captured the post 9/11 mindset, it falls back on an all too familiar post WWII mentality premise. With respect to Nine and Twelve, the more we learn of there past, the more roundabout and overkill their methods become. For a pair of geniuses, they can&#8217;t seem to look past their own hands to the obvious.</p>
<p>The fun of T<i>error in Resonance</i> could be likened to a sophisticated Rube Goldberg machine where a clever setup of incendiaries is undermined at the end when its entire function is to make dry toast. Spectacle is a given from Watanabe and should be reason enough to give a try. It&#8217;s a shame the series falters at the questions of why. But how things unfold is a trail worth some merit. </p>
